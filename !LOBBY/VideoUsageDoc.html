<H3 id="VideoUsage">Video usage</H3>
<p>In the development of SNU 3, videos were downloaded as a point of reference from various sources, mainly YouTube. Videos were used as a reference to page subjects, and some pages showcased these videos.</p>
<p>Not all videos were downloaded, some were made by Sean. Back then, Sean was using Windows Movie Maker 2012, GIMP, and MS-PAINT for production. These videos were mainly slideshows.</p>
<p>Use of video is still used as a point of reference, but it isn't used as much anymore due to file size concerns, and overusage.</p>

<H3 id="DownloadMethod">Download method</H3>
<p>At first, when Sean downloaded videos from YouTube, he used VLC Media Player. VLC Media Player has built in support for streaming and downloading videos from numerous sites. After some inztability issues, and the method just giving up and throwing out errors, an alternate was found agaim.</p>
<p>A site was used "downloadyoutubehd.net" which no longer exists. It was a good site for downloading videos, and its usage predates VLC downloading, along with SNU development. It had lots of sketchy ads, and when it stopped working, more alternates were found.</p>
<p>Another commonly used alternate was y2mate.com, which also stopped working. As of recently, a Firefox extension known as "Video DownloadHelper" is used. Since Sean has not donated $29.00 to get ADP licensing, some ADP content in SNU has a QR code to the website.</p>
<p>Content isn't used as much in the root of SNU anymore, and with SNU lite, over 95% of SNU video content will be removed (just for SNU Lite)</p>
